### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Katya Kamlovskaya, a Data Scientist and Computational Linguist. My career path is far from simple: I did MSc in Linguistics and Translations Studies in Russia and moved to Australia where, after working on various education-related projects for school kids, I got so inspired by the IT projects the students created that I decided to switch from traditional linguistics to natural language processing (which would allow me to combine my passion for languages AND emerging technologies and AI). I learnt to code through free online courses and in 2017 moved from Australia to Luxembourg for my PhD in Computer Science (NLP/Digital Humanities). 
Now I am back to Australia for some time, working remotely for a client in Europe and open for extra NLP/Data Science/Computational Linguistics contract-based work-from-home opportunities.

I speak Russian (native), English (fluent), Japanese (intermediate), French (intermediate), and Luxembourgish (beginner). 

My skills include:

- Python
- Data Science and Data Analytics (SQL, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, DeepNote)
- knowledge of machine learning algorithms, modelling and model evaluation (Tensorflow, Scikit-learn)
- NLP tools (inc. NLTK, Spacy, Hugging Face, Tranformers)
- data visualisation (Tableau, Python packages)
- scientific communication (presenting technical information to non-tech audience)
-
