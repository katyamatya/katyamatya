### Hi there 👋

I am Katya Kamlovskaya, Data Scientist and Computational Linguist. 


My career path is far from straight: I did MSc in Linguistics and Translations Studies in Russia and moved to Australia where did a degree in hospitality and event management, started a translation business, and, after working on various education-related projects for school kids, got so inspired by the IT projects the students created that I decided to switch from traditional linguistics to natural language processing (which would allow me to combine my passion for languages AND emerging technologies and AI). I learnt to code through free online courses and in 2017 moved from Australia to Luxembourg for my PhD in Computer Science (NLP/Digital Humanities). After getting my PhD title I worked for an NLP startup in Luxembourg for a year as a Data Scientist/Computational Linguist, and now I am back to Australia for some time, working remotely for a client in Europe (the same NLP startup) and open for extra NLP/Data Science/Computational Linguistics contract-based work-from-home opportunities.


🌱 My skills include:


- Python
- Data Science and Data Analytics (SQL, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, DeepNote)
- knowledge of machine learning algorithms, modelling and model evaluation (Tensorflow, Scikit-learn)
- text analytics/NLP tools (inc. NLTK, Spacy, Hugging Face, Tranformers)
- data visualisation (Tableau, Python packages)
- scientific communication (presenting technical information to non-tech audience)
- interdisciplinary collaboration


⚡ Fun facts: 


- I am likely to move back to Europe late 2023
- I am training for my third marathon (Brisbane, June 2023)
- I am a paraglider pilot and a mom 
- I speak Russian (native), English (fluent), Japanese (intermediate), French (intermediate), and Luxembourgish (beginner).
